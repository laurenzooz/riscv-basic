# Basic RISC-V Processor Implementation
My bachelor's thesis topic was "Operating Systems for RISC-V Processors". Writing the thesis got me interested about RISC-V, and this repository is my practice project to implement a simple RV32I processor using Verilog.

This branch is just to try things out and completing the FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV tutorial: https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/tree/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV
